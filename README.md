# mocha-webdriver-page-objects-example

A stab at using page objects with mocha and webdriverjs.

This is a first go at trying to apply the [page object model](https://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/PageObjects) pattern to functional tests using mocha and the webdriver js bindings. I wrote this out because I couldn't find any other examples elsewhere. It seems to work OK, but I know it isn't perfect - any pull requests are gladly accepted.

## Get started

Clone the repo, and then install dependencies:

    npm install

Then run the tests:

    node_modules/mocha/bin/mocha
